Q3. Topological Sort
Write a program that takes a directed graph G as input and does the following:

  -> If the graph is a DAG, output a topological ordering of the vertices of G.

  -> If the graph is not a DAG, output a message saying "A directed cycle is detected" and print the vertices of a cycle in the order of a cycle in G. 

  -> Even if there are multiple directed cycles, you need to output only one of them.

Input format:

 Same as Q1 (dfs).
